# SillyLittleConsoleGame
Just a small silly console game I made while I was bored.

Just run the main.py file and then press any key to start moving around the grassy randomly-generated fields.

Move the player character depicted by the ascii character "x" (with WASD commands) to step over as much grass as possible to prevent the fire from spreading, while avoiding it burning you or falling into pits.
Have fun!
